# LECTURE #1: Introduction to IOS Application Development

## Technologies Enabling Mobile Applications

**Advanced hardware technologies**

**Wireless data communication**

-   Package ratio
-   4G, LTE, 5G

**Mobile OS**

-   Android
-   IOS

**Client-server technologies**

-   Socket API, RPC, Distributed Object, Web Service

**Mobile Databases**

**Web Technologies**

-   HTTP, JSON, XML

**SDK for building mobile applications**

-   User Interface API
-   Client-server API
    -   Socket, RPC, Distributed Object, Web Service

**Mobile database API**

**Web API**

-   HTTP, JSON, XML

**Multimedia API**

## Evolution of Mobile Applications

**Mainframe applications**

-   Applications running on mainframe machines
-   Users access applications via dump terminals
-   Data communication is very primitive

**Client-server applications**

-   Computer networking technologies (Internet, LAN)
-   Personal computers (more processing power than terminals)
-   Some part of applications can run on users personal computer

**Mobile applications on handheld devices**

-   Wireless data communication technologies
-   Specialized applications are mobilized

**Mobile applicaitons for smart mobile devices (smart phones, tablets)**

-   Smaller / more powerful mobile devices
-   More applications run on mobile OS
-   REST web service, embedded database etc.

## Characteristics of Mobile Applications

-   Screen size is small
-   Support of different device types
-   One application runs at a time
-   Responsive UI
-   Reaction to users touches / gestures
-   Light-weighted database

## IOS Applications

**Naive** applications running on _iOS_, one of the mobile OS's.

**Market Share**

-   Android: 76%
-   IOS: 22%
-   Others: 2%

**Types of applications:**

-   Social
-   Sports
-   Travel

## IOS Application Development

-   Programming language
    -   Objective-C
    -   Swift (since 2014)
-   iOS exposes iOS SDK via a set of Swift (/Objective-
    C) APIs which developers can use to build iOS
    applications

-   Xcode is an IDE which developers can use to
    develop, test, and build iOS applications

-   Download and Install Xcode on your development
    machine

## Features of Xcode
**Coding**
- Built-in iOS SDKs
- Installation of 3rd-party SDKs
- Code generation of application skeleton
- UI screen editor
  - Storyboard Interface Builder (IB)
  - SwiftUI Interface Builder
- Code editor
- Build applications

**Testing**
- Built-in emulators
- Running builds on emulators
- Debugging

**Creating builds**
