# LECTURE 5: Naive Techniques

## Naïve Pattern

A naïve algorithm pattern is not based on any of the
formal and structured patterns
-   It is usually an adhoc approach

Some real-world software development problems can
be solved efficiently by naive algorithms
-   Contains essential building block of practical software development

When naïve (simple) algorithms are possible and optimal, they should be preferred to complicated patterns.

## Sequential Search
**Sequential Search:** Finding an element of a list with a particular property.
  - It checks each element in sequence until the desired element is found, or the list is exhausted. 
  
*This is also known as **linear search.***

- It is a straightforward approach is to use a loop to check each element of S for the desired property. If a match is found, the element is returned, and the loop is stopped. 
- It runs in O(n) time, provided that each element may be tested in O(1) time.
