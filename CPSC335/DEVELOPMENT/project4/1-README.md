# CPSC 335 PROJECT 4: ALGORITHM A - The Stock Purchase Maximization Problem

**LANGUAGE:** PYTHON

## Brief Overview (From document)

Assume that you are given a set of stocks as an array of arrays. Each entry in the subarray
represents a company, with the number of stocks available and the cumulative value of all available
stocks. You are also given a specific sum of money to invest. Buying a fraction of any item is not
allowed. Your task is to design an algorithm to determine the maximum number of stocks you are
able to purchase. Your solution should give the indices of the array(stocks) to be selected. The
cumulative value of all selected stocks must be equal or less than the given sum. The problem is
similar to a well-known algorithmic optimization problem.


## How to execute this program
