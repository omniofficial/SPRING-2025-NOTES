QUESTION 4: Design an exhaustive search or optimization algorithm that solves the problem below.
Describe your algorithm with clear pseudocode and prove the time efficiency class of your
algorithm, using step counts.

PSUEDOCODE:
## Initialize input bounds
Initialize lower_bound to a
Initialize upper_bound to b

## Finding a Pythagorean triple of x, y and z
For x from a to b:
    For y from x to b:
        For z from y to b:
            If x^2 + y^2 == z^2:
                Return (x, y, z)

## If no triple found
Return None


PROVING EFFICIENCY CLASS:
Step counts (line by line): 1 + 1 + (n+1) + n^2 + n^3 + n^3 + n^3 + 1 = O(n^3)
