# CPSC 335 PROJECT 3: ALGORITHM 1 - The Spread of Fire in a Forest

**LANGUAGE:** PYTHON

## Brief Overview

Assume there are at least two persons in your class project group. You want to schedule a meeting with another group member. You are provided with (a) a schedule of membersâ€™ daily activities, containing times of planned engagements. They are not available to have a meeting you during these periods; (b) the earliest and latest times at which they are available for meetings daily. Your schedule and availabilities are provided too. Write an algorithm that takes in your schedule, your daily availability (earliest time, latest time) and that of your group member (or members), and the duration of the meeting you want to schedule. Time is given and should be returned in 24hr military format (HH:MM), for example: 9:30, 22:21. The given time (output) should be sorted in ascending order.
