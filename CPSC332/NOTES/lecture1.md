# LECTURE 1: Overview

## Need for Evolution into Database Systems

**Complete Data Relationships:** Databases handle complex relationships between data more effectively.

**Data Integrity:** Databases provide built-in mechanisms for maintaining data accuracy and consistency.

**Scalability and Performance:** Modern databases are designed to handle large datasets and high transaction volumes efficiently.

**Transaction Management:** The approach does not support ACID properties, making it unsuitable for environments requiring reliable transactions.

**Mini-world:** Some part of the real world about which data is stored in a database. For example, student grades and transcripts at a university.

**DBMS:** A software system that is designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner.

## Types of Databases and Database Applications

**Traditional Applications:** Numeric and Textural DB's - MySQL, Oracle Database

**Recent Applications:**

-   Multimedia Databases - Adobe Lightroom, Picasa
-   Geograhic Information Systems Databases
-   Biological and Genome Databases
-   Data Warehouses
-   Mobile Databases

## DB System Environments

-   Defines data types structures and constraints
-   Stores data in the form of dictionaries or catalog
-   DB software accesses the stored data in database and also stores as a meta data
